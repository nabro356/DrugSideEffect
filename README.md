<h1>Drug Side Effect Prediction using Grpah Attention Neural Networks</h1>
<h4>This project uses Graph Attention Neural Networks (GANN) to predict the side effects of drugs based on a dataset from Kaggle titled "Drugs, Side Effects, and Medical Conditions." It aims to assist in identifying potential side effects of medications based on various attributes.</h4>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<h3>1. Graph Attention Neural Networks (GANN): A specialized deep learning architecture used to model drug interactions and predict potential side effects.</h3>
<h3>2. Streamlit Interface: An intuitive web-based interface to interact with the model, allowing users to input data and visualize predictions in real-time.</h3>
<h3>3. OpenAI Bot Integration: A conversational agent powered by OpenAI that assists with user queries and explains predictions made by the model.</h3>
